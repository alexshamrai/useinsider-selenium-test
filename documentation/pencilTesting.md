### Testing a Pencil with an Eraser

**Note:** The following checklist is a personal attitude for testing a pencil as a general usage
For specific requirements standards should be used (e.g. ISO 9177-1:2016 Mechanical pencils for technical drawings)

**Functional Testing:**

- Test if the pencil writes smoothly on different paper types:
    - Standard printer paper
    - Notebook paper
    - Glossy paper
    - Recycled paper
    - Design Constructor(Engineering) paper
    - Newsprint paper
- Test if the eraser removes pencil marks on different paper types:
    - Standard printer paper
    - Notebook paper
    - Glossy paper
    - Recycled paper
    - Design Constructor(Engineering) paper
    - Newsprint paper
- Hardness (HB) scale meets requirements
- Check pressure sensitivity
- Check proportions of pencil and eraser(length, diameter etc..) meets requirements
- Check pencil could be sharpened by sharpener tool
- Check pencil could be sharpened by knife
- Check the colour of the pencil meets the requirement

**Usability Testing:**

- Assess the grip and comfort during prolonged use for (children/adults)
- Ensure the eraser is easily accessible and usable
- Eraser and main pencil body are not disassemble accidentally while general usage

**Performance Testing:**

- Check how long the lead lasts before breaking or needing sharpening
- Test how long the eraser lasts with regular use
- Check expenses for developing a pencil are not higher than expected

**Load/Stress Testing:**

- Apply varying pressure levels to see if the lead breaks
- Continuously use the eraser to see at what point it becomes ineffective
- Test the pencil and eraser's performance under different temperature conditions, especially for extreme cold or heat
- Check how/high humidity affects the pencil's lead and eraser
- Pencil and eraser could be used in vacuum

**Security Testing:**

- Be sure materials for pencil and eraser meets standards

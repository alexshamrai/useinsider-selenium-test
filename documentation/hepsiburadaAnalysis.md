**Summary of the Recommendation Rule**: The rule for listing and showing products to the user seems to be a combination
of predefined placement types (e.g., `home_page.web-rank28`), user/session-based customization (through anonymousId and
sessionId), and dynamic content rendering based on user interaction and detailed product information. The system likely
uses these parameters to tailor the recommendations to the user's browsing context and preferences. The initial request
sets up the recommendation section, the JavaScript file handles the dynamic aspects and user interactions, and the
detailed API call enriches the section with comprehensive product data.

In essence, the recommendation system is designed to provide a personalized and interactive user experience, driven by a
combination of static web structures, dynamic client-side scripting, and detailed server-side data retrieval.
